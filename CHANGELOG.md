## This library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).
## This CHANGELOG follows [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

###  VERSION 3.0.0
#### Changed
* use aerospike client version 6.1.10
* use test containers for integration tests

#### Added
* batch operate support
* completion executor support (with default)
* client-events additional context support

#### Removed
* empty test namespace

###  VERSION 2.0.7
#### Changed
* Fixed a bug with reporting metrics for `AerospikeSingleIndexBatchOps/operate`.

#### Removed
* 2 unused dev profile plugins.
* Unnecessary integration test.

### VERSION 2.0.6
#### Changed
* Performance and memory optimization, mainly in the core `aerospike-clj.aerospike-record/record->map` function.

### VERSION 2.0.5
#### Changed
* TTLs for the mock client are now correctly mocked:
  * TTL is stored (and returned in get operations) as seconds from Aerospike epoch time
#### Updated
* Dependencies
  * promesa 6.0.0 -> 8.0.450
  * org.clojure/tools.logging 1.1.0 -> 1.2.4

### VERSION 2.0.3
#### Changed
* Add missing configuration for eftest to out the test results to target/junit.xml.
* Upgrade `EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v1.6` -> `EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v1.39`.

### VERSION 2.0.2
#### Changed
* The behavior of the mocked `replace-only`. 
  It should throw an AerospikeException when the item doesn't exist.

### VERSION 2.0.1
#### Updated
* Links in README and CI config.

### VERSION 2.0.0
#### Added
 * Aerospike `Key` - can now coerce `java.util.UUID` into keys alongside byte arrays, 
  ints, longs, strings and `com.aerospike.client.Value`.
 * Created the `protocols` namespace which now holds a myriad of protocols.
   * This includes new protocols that group Aerospike operations by CRUD/admin semantics.
 * Can explicitly specify the port in the host string that is passed to the client
 constructor `init-simple-aerospike-client`.
* Integration test namespace now has the `^:integration` metadata:
  * Run unit tests with `lein test`
  * Run integration tests that require a locally-running Aerospike client via `lein test :integration`.
#### Changed
* Artifact coordinates in [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) have changed from `aerospike-clj/aerospike-clj`
to `com.appsflyer/aerospike-clj`.
* Upgraded dependency on [`promesa`](https://github.com/funcool/promesa) from `5.1.0` to `6.0.0`.
* Implementations of `ClientEvents` protocol will no longer get the DB instance 
for runtime parameters. Instead, they should be pre-configured at instance construction time.
* Cleaned up the `client` namespace:
  * Removed the `IAerospikeClient` protocol it can create a collision with `com.aerospike.client.IAerospikeClient`. 
  Abstracting over the Java client instance selection is of no concern to a simple 
  client that interacts with a single cluster.
    * As a result `SimpleAerospikeClient` now directly uses the vars passed in 
    construction time instead of fetching them from the `client` with keywords, e.g. `(:el client)`.
    * The return type of `get-cluster-stats` is no longer a triply-nested vector, 
    but a doubly-nested vector.
  * All protocols moved to `protocols` namespace.
  * `SimpleAerospikeClient` record now implements the protocols mentioned above.
* Mock client
  * The `MockClient` record now implements the protocols mentioned above, so 
  production code could now have its `SimpleAerospikeClient` swapped with a mock 
  client in-place and __without__ using `with-redefs`.
  * Functionality that is needed for unit testing purposes is defined in the 
  `Stateful` protocol and `MockClient` instances are extended to this protocol.
* Logging via [`tools.logging`](https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging) as a fa√ßade.
* CI
  * No longer runs the lein command `compile` - it would be executed implicitly by `test`
#### Removed
 * The function `get-multiple` was removed in favor of the protocol method `get-batch`.
 * Dependency on [`timbre`](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre).

### VERSION 1.0.2
#### Added:
* This CHANGELOG now follows [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
* CI with GitHub Actions.
* Linting with [`clj-kondo`](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo).

#### VERSION 1.0.0
#### This is a breaking change.
* Chaining via implementing `ClientEvents` now supports passing also a vector,
  and results in chaining all completion by order they were given.
* The returned result is now a Java(8<) `CompletableFuture` instead of `manifold/Deferred`.
* All listeners factored out of the main `client` namespace.

#### VERSION 0.6.0
* Support ClientEvents vector to be a vector of completions instead of a single one.
* Bump aerospike lib to 4.4.15

#### VERSION 0.5.1
